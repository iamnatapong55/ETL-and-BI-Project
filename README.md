# ETL-and-BI-Project

No one discusses Data Analytics and Data Science issues yet everyone tries their hand at solving these challenges. Everyone already knows that in the future, data science and analytics will be a requirement. While developers and non-developers alike may have trouble developing a great customizable, scalable, and modular code pipeline, when they try to connect their Data Analytics solution with their complete project's architecture, a lot of individuals are stuck on the challenge of doing so. On this project, I will be doing extracting, transforming and loading data from disparate data sources to data warehouse then display onto the business intelligence tool - Tableau.
